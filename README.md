# tau-web-rust

The implementation of the tau-web harness: a client-side AI harness that runs in a phone
browser and provisions real infrastructure on its operator's behalf. Rust, compiled to
WebAssembly, following the configuration the specification records.

**The specification lives in [`douglaz/tau-web-spec`](https://github.com/douglaz/tau-web-spec)
and is vendored here at `spec/`, pinned to an exact commit** (spec ADR-0031). The build refuses
to run if the checked-out tree does not match the pin, and every release records the spec commit
it was built from. What the build compiles in from the pin:

- `spec/bundle/` — the artifact pin and accepted signers, the inference target, the named
  timings, and the CORS probe;
- `spec/docs/tenants/` — the tenant profiles;
- the briefs promoted out of draft (none yet).

`spec/bundle/cors-probe.sh` and `spec/prototypes/spec-checks/` run from the pinned tree as this
repository's CI gate (spec `CNF-1`–`CNF-4`).

Start reading at [`spec/00-overview.md`](./spec/00-overview.md). What to build first is
[`spec/06-first-stage.md`](./spec/06-first-stage.md); what it must demonstrate is the
first-stage row of [`spec/07-conformance.md`](./spec/07-conformance.md).
