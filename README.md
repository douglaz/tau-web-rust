# tau-web-rust

The implementation of the tau-web harness: a client-side AI harness that runs in a phone
browser and provisions real infrastructure on its operator's behalf. Rust, compiled to
WebAssembly, following the configuration the specification records.

**The specification lives in [`douglaz/tau-web-spec`](https://github.com/douglaz/tau-web-spec)
and is vendored here at `spec/`, pinned to an exact commit** (spec ADR-0031). The build refuses
to run if the checked-out tree does not match the pin, and every release records the spec commit
it was built from. What the build compiles in from the pin:

- `spec/bundle/` — the artifact pin and accepted signers, the inference target, the named
  timings, and the CORS probe;
- `spec/docs/tenants/` — the tenant profiles;
- the briefs promoted out of draft (none yet).

`spec/bundle/cors-probe.sh` and `spec/prototypes/spec-checks/` run from the pinned tree as this
repository's CI gate. The probe is spec `CNF-4`, "The CORS probe runs on every push (`ARC-34`),
and its failure fails the build"; the disk checks are evidence for spec `CNF-85` and for nothing
else. Until this pin both were labelled `CNF-1`–`CNF-4`, which the specification's own task list
records as a mislabel to correct here.

Start reading at [`spec/00-overview.md`](./spec/00-overview.md). What to build first is
[`spec/06-first-stage.md`](./spec/06-first-stage.md); what it must demonstrate is the
first-stage row of [`spec/07-conformance.md`](./spec/07-conformance.md).

No harness code yet: `src/lib.rs` holds the pinned inputs and nothing else.

## The gates

`build.rs` refuses to build unless `spec/` is the pinned tree — the commit HEAD records for the
submodule, actually checked out there, with no local change under it, an untracked file
included, since a scan of `docs/tenants/` would compile one in. It then parses every
`spec/bundle/*.toml` and compiles them and each `spec/docs/tenants/*/profile.md` in, exposing
the spec commit as `tau_web::SPEC_COMMIT`.

No brief is promoted out of draft yet, so none is compiled in. Since the corpus marks a draft
only in its own prose, the build watches that sentence: a brief that stops saying it is "not
yet in the signed bundle" stops the build, so promotion is decided here rather than shipping
as nothing.

**`cargo build` fails today, and should.** `bundle/inference.toml` carries an empty `model` and
`provider`: publisher decisions the build must not guess (`ARC-31`, `STG-17`). Filling them is a
commit to the specification repository and a pin bump here; until then the `build` job is red
and the `spec-checks` job is not.

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs, on every push and pull request:

| Job | Runs | For |
|---|---|---|
| `spec-checks` | `spec/bundle/cors-probe.sh` | `CNF-4` |
| | `spec/prototypes/spec-checks/check-install-disks.py`, and `--baseline`, which must fail | evidence for `CNF-85` |
| `build` (the job is `CNF-1`) | `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings` | `CNF-2`, at that strictness |
| | `cargo test --locked` | runs `build.rs`, so the gates above run here |

Both jobs check out the submodule; `spec-checks` takes the full history, which
`check-install-disks.py --baseline` reads to reconstruct the pre-fix brief.

`CNF-3` in its general form — "The test suite fails when a test is deliberately broken" — was
verified by hand on 2026-09-21, against a temporary pin filling the inference slugs: the one
test was broken deliberately, `cargo test` went red naming it, the restored test went green.
The three further breaks `CNF-3` names are the companion comparison's (ADR-0032), and wait on
the test that reads a witness file, which does not exist here yet.
